TODO
====

- multiple copies of the same building should probably show a different color automatically.
  Also consider letters on prod/maint modules to mark which building they are for?
- Don't load all information for every layout (buildingMap, etc.).
- cleanup when leaving editor (grid objects on layout)
- total production/cost display.
- Roads
- Export/Import
- Exit placement mode if you switch to another mode (like demolish).
- Demo mode should support dragging.

- make more spritesheets for buttons/hovers.
- error while trying to open editor for unknown id.
- ng-cloak on the editor popup.  Doens't seem to work as expected, still see flicker on editor (in FF).
- Cancel placing a new building (esc or click off-grid?).
- Maintenance information in popup.
- Click on module should show popup with information (maintenance and production).
- Popup on hover of building icons.

- Copy
- Move
- Placement markers.
- hover on build building icons should have popup
- Different grids.
    - islands, with coastal and mountain sites.
- prettify

- Keyboard shortcuts:
    S = street
    H = small residence
    Shift + H = large residence
    D = Demolition
    C = copy
    m = move

- Add new layout, then hit cancel, doesn't delete.


- Check out Bootlint https://github.com/twbs/bootlint
- Update the title on page change.  Not entirely clear how to properly do this.

- Figure out how to get html5Mode going.  Particularly, setting <base> in dev environment versus live?  What if you don't know what base is going to be?
- Decide if ngStorage is good compared to https://github.com/adrianmay/rhaboo.
